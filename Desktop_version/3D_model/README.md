# Description
Bottom is composed of 3 pieces :
* bottom-a.stl
* bottom-b.stl
* bottom-c.stl

All this part are assembled in one with Slic3r as bottom.amf file.

I'm using a dual head printer but you should be able to do this with single head. There is some technics to change filament like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnbQ0YTZnmk). *I've not tested*
